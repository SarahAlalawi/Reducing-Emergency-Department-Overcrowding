# Reducing Emergency Department Overcrowding
Our own work was user facing, targeting the root of the ED overcrowding but not using the waiting time as a solution. Instead, we fostered an unimplemented idea called "Early Warning System". The general idea behind the "Early Warning System" is to prevent the overcrowding before it happens. We used the same approach, in order to develop our own algorithm that can detect the early stages of overcrowding and warn both,the hospital ED and the patient. Moreover, our system offers other options to get medical care rather than to go immediately to an ED and contribute in causing the overcrowding problem.
